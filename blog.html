                </h2>
                <p>One of these factors is the role of stereotypes, which is reinforced by social and cultural norms that underline certain expectations about gender. While it is expected for men to go to work, it is viewed as more of a choice for women. Events exclusive to gender, such as “Women in Business” or “Women in Entrepreneurship”, add to the stereotype that women need help and guidance, as they are perceived to be too sensitive to fight their way to success in business. Therefore it becomes important for women to ask questions such as whether they want to be judged on their abilities and talent or their gender. If they feel that they want to be judged by their talent, they need to set an example so that other women can be inspired to follow.</p>

                  <span class="section-heading-lower">The business case for prioritising employee mental health</span>
                </h2>
                <p>There is a clear business case for companies to prioritise these issues. The monetary impact of the decision to sack employees increases a company’s overall turnover cost. Studies on the cost of employee turnover predict that every time a business replaces a salaried employee, it costs 6- 9 months’ salary on average. Many employers argue that this cost is less compared to losses from under-performing employees, and because of long-term benefits, replacement of the employee is worth the turnover cost. However, if businesses invest in employee mental well-being, they would not only help employees recover, but also increase the productivity of the business and avoid the turnover cost. Fostering good mental health also helps create a more inclusive and positive culture within the company, and furthers the corporate social responsibility cause which many companies value.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The internet really created the capacity for disruptive innovation to come alive when combined with passionate users, leading to an explosion of creative collaboration. Today, the majority of the big firms leverage ‘open innovation’ tools such as crowdsourcing, lead users and innovative intermediaries to explore new ideas. Globalisation, technological progress, the rise of mobility and easy availability of information are all enablers of the use of open innovation methods.
